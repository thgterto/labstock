# Track Specification: Project Setup & Conductor Initialization

## Goal
Initialize the development environment and the Conductor workflow structure to enable structured development for LabControl 2.0 Web.

## Requirements
1.  **Environment**: Node.js dependencies must be installed and the app must build.
2.  **Conductor**: The `conductor/` directory must exist with `workflow.md`, `product.md`, and `tracks.md`.
3.  **Documentation**: Key architectural patterns and tech stack must be documented in `conductor/tech-stack.md` or `product.md`.

## Context
Based on research findings in `thoughts/shared/research/2024-05-22-labcontrol-patterns.md`, the project was missing the Conductor structure referenced in `PRD.md`.
